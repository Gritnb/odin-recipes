        <h2>What is lasagne?</h2>
        <p class="info"> 
            Like many classic Italian recipes, lasagne’s true history is disputed. That being said, it is generally accepted that lasagne was created in Naples during the Middle Ages. The first recorded recipe for a dish that resembles lasagne was noted in the early 14th-century text Liber de Coquina, meaning The Book of Cookery. However, the recipe described bears little resemblance to the lasagne we enjoy today, instead consisting of a fermented dough, flattened into thin sheets and boiled. This dough was then topped with cheese and various spices, before being consumed with the aid of a pointed stick. Please note here, this is not a utensil we’d advise using to eat modern lasagne.

        <p class="info">
            Lasagne is a classic Italian al forno dish that generally consists of alternating layers of pasta sheets and various fillings, including - though not exclusively - ragù, besciamella and cheese, such as mozzarella, ricotta or Parmesan. Typically, this assembled dish is then baked in an oven until piping hot and all the cheese has melted. Beloved worldwide, lasagne is especially popular in the US, where they celebrate national Lasagne day on the 29th July.

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Gather all your ingredients.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
